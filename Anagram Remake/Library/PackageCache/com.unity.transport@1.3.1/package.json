    "changelog": "### Changes\n* It is now possible to set a window size of up to 64 for `ReliableSequencedPipelineStage` (use `NetworkSettings.WithReliableStageParameters` to modify the value). Doing so increases the packet header size by 4 bytes though, so the default value remains at 32.\n\n### Fixes\n* Fixed an issue where if one end of a reliable pipeline stopped sending any traffic and its latest ACK message was lost, then the other end would stall.\n* Fixed a crash when using DTLS if an update was delayed for long enough that both the disconnection and heartbeat timeouts expire."
